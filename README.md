**Purr-fect (Mr.) Chef** is a 2D pixel-ish game where you play as an adorable kitten who has decided that cooking is his calling. Run around levels, sniff out ingredients, and cook dishes according to recipes. Impress the invisible Michelin gods.  
~~(Or don’t.)~~

## 🍎 Game Highlights
- **Explore** like you mean it – walk, bump, bonk into things. (Some of them are useful.)
- **Recipe System** – combine stuff until something edible happens.
- **Inventory** – because cats have paws, not pockets.
- **Collisions** – realistic-ish interactions. ~~(You will get stuck. It’s a feature.)~~
- **Progress Saving** – because even rebellious kittens deserve checkpoints.
